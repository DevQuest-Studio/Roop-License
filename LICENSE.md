- **Roop**: The complete Roblox framework‚Äîmodel files (`.rbxm`/`.rbxl`), Remote Modules, packages, scripts, GUIs, signals, assets, configurations, and documentation‚Äîauthored by KristoStl.  
- **Repository**: `https://github.com/KristoStl/Roop` (all branches, tags, releases).  
- **Developer / You / Your**: Any person or entity accessing, forking, cloning, integrating, or distributing Roop.  
- **Experience**: A Roblox Place or Universe embedding Roop.  
- **License Key**: A 32-character alphanumeric code issued by KristoStl to authorize one Experience.  
- **Activation API**: HTTPS endpoint that validates your License Key at runtime.  
- **Unauthorized Data**: Any player or system data beyond Roblox `UserId`, session tokens, and owner-approved telemetry.  
- **Minor Update**: Patch or bug-fix release within v1.x.  
- **Major Upgrade**: Version bump to v2.0.0 or above (requires new license).  
- **Derivative Works**: Any adaptation, translation, or extension of Roop‚Äôs code, assets, or docs.  
- **Audit**: Authorized inspection of your codebase, activation logs, or usage metrics.  
- **Force Majeure**: Events beyond reasonable control (acts of God, government orders, widespread outages).  

---

## 2. Grant of License  
- Roop is **licensed**, not sold; all rights not expressly granted are reserved by KristoStl.  
- You receive a **limited**, **non-exclusive**, **non-transferable**, **revocable** license to integrate and use Roop in **one** Experience per License Key.  
- This license covers all **Minor Updates** (v1.x) at no additional fee.  
- **Major Upgrades** (v2.0+) require execution of a new, written license agreement.  
- You may clone or fork the Repository **privately** for development, QA, staging, or CI/CD.  
- You may distribute compiled ModuleScripts that invoke Roop‚Äî**never** raw `.rbxm`/`.rbxl` assets.  
- You may archive encrypted backup copies of Roop for disaster recovery.  
- You may integrate Roop‚Äôs client/server APIs exactly as documented.  
- You may display a ‚ÄúPowered by Roop‚Äù badge on loading screens or footers.  
- You may enable opt-in telemetry; end-user disclosure is required.  
- You may run closed alpha/beta tests under a **Beta License** (expires after 30 days).  
- You may localize UI text and fonts, provided ModuleScript APIs remain unchanged.  
- You may use Roop in group-owned Experiences if you hold primary dev rights.  
- You may spawn up to **10** concurrent Roop Manager instances per server process.  
- License is void if you sublicense, sell, lease, or assign it to any third party.

## 3. Installation & Activation  
1. Obtain Roop **only** from this official Repository. Third-party mirrors are prohibited.  
2. Follow `/docs/INSTALL.md` **step by step**; skipping steps voids your license.  
3. Place `Settings.lua` and `Activation.lua` in a locked `ServerStorage/RoopConfig` folder.  
4. Insert your **PlaceId** and **License Key**; do **not** commit them to source control.  
5. Activation uses HTTPS/TLS 1.2+; HTTP is unsupported and will be blocked.  
6. On game startup, `Activation.lua` contacts the Activation API with your PlaceId and Key.  
7. If validation fails, Roop enters **Safe Mode**: all non-essential features disable.  
8. Five consecutive failed activations lock your License Key for 24 hours.  
9. Report any License Key compromise to kristostl@example.com within 24 hours.  
10. CI/CD pipelines may call the Activation API via encrypted environment variables only.  
11. Activation logs are AES-256 encrypted in `ServerStorage/RoopLogs/activations.json`.  
12. KristoStl may read these logs (read-only) for compliance audits.  
13. Do **not** rename or relocate `Activation.lua`; doing so breaks license enforcement.  
14. Activation is rate-limited to **100** calls/hour per PlaceId; excess calls are throttled.  
15. Offline testing is allowed for up to **48 hours**‚Äîlive activation required thereafter.  
16. Staging keys auto-expire after 30 days; production keys renew annually.  
17. Key rotation requires revoking the old key, then requesting a new one.  
18. Key revocation events trigger email alerts to kristostl@example.com and the Experience owner.  
19. Any attempt to intercept or spoof Activation API traffic voids your license immediately.  
20. Automated remediation scripts may re-activate keys only with an Owner-signed token.  
21. A self-hosted Activation API is possible under a separate NDA and addendum.

- You may not proxy Roop calls through unauthorized middleware or proxies.  
- Debouncing or throttling is allowed‚Äîrespect the documented maximum rate limits.
