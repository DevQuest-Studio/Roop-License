## 2. End User License Agreement (EULA)

### 2.1 Grant of License  
- Roop is licensed, not sold, to you under this EULA.  
- You receive a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install Roop in one Roblox game.  
- This license permits up to five instances of Roop per game, for development, testing, and production.  
- You may create derivative game logic around Roop‚Äôs APIs but not derivative copies of Roop assets.  
- License covers all current versions and minor updates (bug-fixes, performance patches).  
- Major version upgrades may require a renewed license agreement.  
- License includes use of Roop‚Äôs user interface components in accordance with branding guidelines.  
- You may distribute compiled Lua scripts that invoke Roop but not Roop‚Äôs source files themselves.  
- You may bundle Roop with your game on Roblox, provided Roop‚Äôs files remain individually named and unencrypted.  
- You may implement Roop in closed or invite-only experiences, respecting Roblox Terms of Service.  
- You may customize UI labels and colors, but not the core functionality signature of Roop.  
- You may use Roop in non-commercial, educational, or testing environments without additional fees.

- Activation call occurs at game initialization; failure to activate disables Roop features.  
- Installation via Asset-Service is permitted only with the official asset bundle ID.  
- Do not rename folders or mismatch module script hierarchies; this voids the license.  
- Ensure network requests to Roop‚Äôs CDN are allowed; offline operation is unsupported.  
- Activation logs are stored encrypted in ServerStorage/roop_activations.json.  
- Unauthorized tampering with Activation.lua triggers self-destruct logic after five failed attempts.

- Upon termination you must remove Roop modules from all places and archives.  
- You must purge any backups or CI caches containing Roop source.  
- You may be required to furnish a sworn statement of compliance within 10 days.
